    <p id='story'>It has often been said that "a dog is a man's best {{n1}}." Dogs are very {{a1 || 'ADJECTIVE'}} and can be taught many {{a2 || 'ADJECTIVE'}} tricks. A dog can be trained to carry an {{n2 || 'NOUN'}} in his mouth, and if you throw his {{n3 || 'NOUN'}}, he will run and fetch it. Dogs will also bark {{ad || 'ADVERB'}} if someone tries to break into your {{n4 || 'NOUN'}} during the night. One of the most popular canine pets today is the <span class="capitalize">{{n5 || 'NOUN'}}</span> Spaniel. Spaniels have curly {{co || 'COLOR'}} coats and {{a3 || 'ADJECTIVE'}} ears. They also have very {{a4 || 'ADJECTIVE'}} dispositions and live to be {{no * 7 || 'NUMBER'}} years old. Other popular dogs are <span class="capitalize">{{a5 || 'ADJECTIVE'}}</span> Terriers, German <span class="capitalize">{{pn || 'PLURAL NOUN'}}</span>, and the <span class="capitalize">{{a6 || 'ADJECTIVE'}}</span> Poodle. Every home should have a loyal dog for a {{n6 || 'NOUN'}}.</p>
